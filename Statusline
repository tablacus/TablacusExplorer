I have just found your tablacus explorer and I like it very much.
It is almost the explorer I am looking for since a long time.
What I miss, is a statusline, giving the number of files in a directory and the number of selected files.
Is there some add-on for this? I did not find it.
Can you please add it?

Many thanks
Karl
